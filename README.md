PSCS42-Radar On Roads
There will be huge pile of vehicles waiting to pass through the toll booths over weekends around many cities. Though the NHAI 
has introduced FASTag RFID stickers, it still doesn’t address the issue. In many places its still not functional and at few it’s 
partially working. Places where it’s working, the vehicle needs to go slow so the sensors to detect the sticker and deduct the toll 
fare. What if we had a system which is similar or better to one being used in Dubai?
